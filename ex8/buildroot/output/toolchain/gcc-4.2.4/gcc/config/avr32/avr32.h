*/
#define STRICT_ALIGNMENT 1

/*
Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers handle
alignment of bit-fields and the structures that contain them.

The behavior is that the type written for a bit-field (int,
short, or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the
entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an ordinary
field of that type.  In addition, the bit-field is placed within the
structure so that it would fit within such a field, not crossing a
boundary for it.

Thus, on most machines, a bit-field whose type is written as int
would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not be four
bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment parameters.)

If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.

Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
bit-fields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The compiler can
support such references if there are insv, extv, and
extzv insns that can directly reference memory.

The other known way of making bit-fields work is to define
STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY as large as BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT.
Then every structure can be accessed with fullwords.

Unless the machine has bit-field instructions or you define
STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY that way, you must define
PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS to have a nonzero value.

If your aim is to make GCC use the same conventions for laying out
bit-fields as are used by another compiler, here is how to investigate
what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this program:

struct foo1
{
  char x;
  char :0;
  char y;
};

struct foo2
{
  char x;
  int :0;
  char y;
};

main ()
{
  printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
          sizeof (struct foo1));
  printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
          sizeof (struct foo2));
  exit (0);
}

If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you would
get from PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS.

/** How Values Fit in Registers **/

/*
A C expression for the number of consecutive hard registers, starting
at register number REGNO, required to hold a value of mode
MODE.

On a machine where all registers are exactly one word, a suitable
definition of this macro is

#define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE)            \
   ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)  \
    / UNITS_PER_WORD)
*/
#define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE) \
  ((unsigned int)((GET_MODE_SIZE(MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD -1 ) / UNITS_PER_WORD))

/*
A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a value
of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO (or in several
registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all registers
are equivalent, a suitable definition is

  #define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1

You need not include code to check for the numbers of fixed registers,
because the allocation mechanism considers them to be always occupied.

On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
register pairs.  You can implement that by defining this macro to reject
odd register numbers for such modes.

The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that the
mov[mode] instruction pattern support moves between the
register and other hard register in the same class and that moving a
value into the register and back out not alter it.

Since the same instruction used to move word_mode will work for
all narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK to distinguish between these modes, provided
you define patterns movhi, etc., to take advantage of this.  This
is useful because of the interaction between HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK
and MODES_TIEABLE_P; it is very desirable for all integer modes
to be tieable.

Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.
Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed only
in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any registers that
can hold integers can safely hold a floating point machine
mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done on it in those
registers.  Integer move instructions can be used to move the values.

On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the floating
registers normalize any value stored in them, because storing a
non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK should reject fixed-point machine modes in
floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not automatically
normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one and retrieve it
unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode may go in a floating
register, so you can define this macro to say so.

The primary significance of special floating registers is rather that
they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK.  You handle it by writing the proper
constraints for those instructions.

On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to access,
so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame than in such a
register if floating point arithmetic is not being done.  As long as the
floating registers are not in class GENERAL_REGS, they will not
be used unless some pattern's constraint asks for one.

any R, then MODES_TIEABLE_P(MODE1, MODE2)

this macro to return zero unless some other mechanism ensures the
accessibility of the value in a narrower mode.

You should define this macro to return nonzero in as many cases as

FUNDECL is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
FUNCTION_DECL that describes the declaration of the function.
From this you can obtain the DECL_ATTRIBUTES of the function.

FUNTYPE is a C variable whose value is a tree node that
describes the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
FUNCTION_TYPE that describes the data type of the function.
From this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
arguments (if known).

When a call to a library function is being considered, FUNDECL
will contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if
you need to distinguish among various library functions, you can do so
by their names.  Note that ``library function'' in this context means
a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known specially
in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being compiled.

STACK_SIZE is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the
stack.  If a variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and
argument popping will always be the responsibility of the calling function.

On the VAX, all functions always pop their arguments, so the definition
of this macro is STACK_SIZE.  On the 68000, using the standard
calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so the value of
the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an alternative calling
convention is available in which functions that take a fixed number of
arguments pop them but other functions (such as printf) pop
nothing (the caller pops all).  When this convention is in use,
FUNTYPE is examined to determine whether a function takes a fixed
number of arguments.

/* Passing Arguments in Registers */

/*
A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed
in a register, and which register.

The arguments are CUM, which summarizes all the previous
arguments; MODE, the machine mode of the argument; TYPE,
the data type of the argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known
(which happens for C support library functions); and NAMED,
which is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for nameless arguments that
correspond to '...' in the called function's prototype.
TYPE can be an incomplete type if a syntax error has previously
occurred.

The value of the expression is usually either a reg RTX for the
hard register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
argument on the stack.

For machines like the VAX and 68000, where normally all arguments are
pushed, zero suffices as a definition.

The value of the expression can also be a parallel RTX.  This is
used when an argument is passed in multiple locations.  The mode of the
of the parallel should be the mode of the entire argument.  The
parallel holds any number of expr_list pairs; each one
describes where part of the argument is passed.  In each
expr_list the first operand must be a reg RTX for the hard
register in which to pass this part of the argument, and the mode of the
register RTX indicates how large this part of the argument is.  The
second operand of the expr_list is a const_int which gives
the offset in bytes into the entire argument of where this part starts.
As a special exception the first expr_list in the parallel
RTX may have a first operand of zero.  This indicates that the entire
argument is also stored on the stack.

The last time this macro is called, it is called with MODE == VOIDmode,
and its result is passed to the call or call_value
pattern as operands 2 and 3 respectively.

The usual way to make the ISO library 'stdarg.h' work on a machine
where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
by making FUNCTION_ARG return 0 whenever NAMED is 0.

You may use the macro MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)
in the definition of this macro to determine if this argument is of a
type that must be passed in the stack.  If REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE
is not defined and FUNCTION_ARG returns nonzero for such an
argument, the compiler will abort.  If REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE is
defined, the argument will be computed in the stack and then loaded into
a register.  */

It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
understand.

This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
with no hard register must be rejected.

The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be defined to
accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some kind of
register is required.

Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
macro define the macro REG_OK_STRICT.  You should use an
#ifdef REG_OK_STRICT conditional to define the strict variant
in that case and the non-strict variant otherwise.

Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes (one
for base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are typically
among the subroutines used to define GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS.
Then only these subroutine macros need have two variants; the higher
levels of macros may be the same whether strict or not.

Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a symbol_ref
and an integer are stored inside a const RTX to mark them as
constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
recognize any const as legitimate.

Usually PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS is not prepared to handle constant
sums that are not marked with  const.  It assumes that a naked
plus indicates indexing.  If so, then you must reject such
naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of them will
be given to PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS.

On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends on
the section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
macro ENCODE_SECTION_INFO to store the information into the
symbol_ref, and then check for it here.  When you see a
const, you will have to look inside it to find the
symbol_ref in order to determine the section.

The best way to modify the name string is by adding text to the
beginning, with suitable punctuation to prevent any ambiguity.  Allocate
the new name in saveable_obstack.  You will have to modify
ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF to remove and decode the added text and
output the name accordingly, and define STRIP_NAME_ENCODING to
access the original name string.

You can check the information stored here into the symbol_ref in
the definitions of the macros GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS and
PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS.

This macro is not used on machines that do not use cc0.

If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
NOTICE_UPDATE_CC can leave cc_status unaltered for such
insns.  But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code
based on location 'a4@@(102)' and the current insn stores a new
value in 'a4'.  Although the condition code is not changed by
this, it will no longer be true that it reflects the contents of
'a4@@(102)'.  Therefore, NOTICE_UPDATE_CC must alter
cc_status in this case to say that nothing is known about the
condition code value.

The definition of NOTICE_UPDATE_CC must be prepared to deal
with the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
parallel RTXs containing various reg, mem or
constants which are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these
insns is not sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
NOTICE_UPDATE_CC should do when it sees one is just to run
CC_STATUS_INIT.

A possible definition of NOTICE_UPDATE_CC is to call a function
that looks at an attribute (see Insn Attributes) named, for example,
'cc'.  This avoids having detailed information about patterns in
two places, the 'md' file and in NOTICE_UPDATE_CC.

It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the
same as TO; on some machines it is expensive to move between
registers if they are not general registers.

If reload sees an insn consisting of a single set between two
hard registers, and if REGISTER_MOVE_COST applied to their
classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that the
constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than 2 will

If you do not define this macro, GCC uses a default cost of 4 plus
the cost of copying via a secondary reload register, if one is
needed.  If your machine requires a secondary reload register to copy
between memory and a register of CLASS but the reload mechanism is
more complex than copying via an intermediate, define this macro to
reflect the actual cost of the move.

GCC defines the function memory_move_secondary_cost if
secondary reloads are needed.  It computes the costs due to copying via
a secondary register.  If your machine copies from memory using a
secondary register in the conventional way but the default base value of
4 is not correct for your machine, define this macro to add some other

added.  Use alloca to get space for the string.

The string will be used as an argument to ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF to
produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose name is
NAME.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in valid
assembler code.  The argument NUMBER is different each time this
macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between similarly-named
internal static variables in different scopes.

Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent any
conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow periods
or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least one of these
between the name and the number will suffice.
