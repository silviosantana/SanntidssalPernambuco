muse-rodata-section
Target Report Mask(USE_RODATA_SECTION)
Use section .rodata for read-only data instead of .text.

mhard-float
Target Report Undocumented Mask(HARD_FLOAT)
Use floating point coprocessor instructions.

msoft-float
Target Report Undocumented InverseMask(HARD_FLOAT, SOFT_FLOAT)
Use software floating-point library for floating-point operations.

mforce-double-align
Target Report RejectNegative Mask(FORCE_DOUBLE_ALIGN)
Force double-word alignment for double-word memory accesses.

mno-init-got
Target Report RejectNegative Mask(NO_INIT_GOT)
Do not initialize GOT register before using it when compiling PIC code.

mrelax
Target Report Mask(RELAX)
Let invoked assembler and linker do relaxing (Enabled by default when optimization level is >1).

mmd-reorg-opt
Target Report Undocumented Mask(MD_REORG_OPTIMIZATION)
Perform machine dependent optimizations in reorg stage.

masm-addr-pseudos
Target Report Mask(HAS_ASM_ADDR_PSEUDOS) 
Use assembler pseudo-instructions lda.w and call for handling direct addresses. (Enabled by default)

mpart=
Target Report RejectNegative Joined Var(avr32_part_name)
Specify the AVR32 part name

mcpu=
Target Report RejectNegative Joined Undocumented Var(avr32_part_name)
Specify the AVR32 part name (deprecated)

march=
Target Report RejectNegative Joined Var(avr32_arch_name)
Specify the AVR32 architecture name

mfast-float
Target Report Mask(FAST_FLOAT)
Enable fast floating-point library. Enabled by default if the -funsafe-math-optimizations switch is specified.

mimm-in-const-pool
Target Report Var(avr32_imm_in_const_pool) Init(-1)
Put large immediates in constant pool. This is enabled by default for archs with insn-cache.

mno-pic
Target Report RejectNegative Mask(NO_PIC)
Do not generate position-independent code. (deprecated, use -fno-pic instead)

mcond-exec-before-reload
Target Report Undocumented Mask(COND_EXEC_BEFORE_RELOAD) 
Enable experimental conditional execution preparation before the reload stage.
