NEWS for module-init-tools
--------------------------

generate-modules.conf is now deprecated, as the old modutils is no longer
  supported at all.  As such, this file is no longer installed by default
  (it will have to be manually installed if you need it), and all packages
  should be migrated away from needing it as soon as possible.

* Release 3.8 was ??
* Release 3.7 was ??
* Release 3.6 was a regular maintenance release.
* Release 3.5 included a lot of cleanups, new module indexing
