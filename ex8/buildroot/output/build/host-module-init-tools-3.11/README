PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.
THERE IS NO BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY FOR PRE-2.6 KERNELS!

1a) If you want to install in /sbin:
	./configure --prefix= --mandir=/usr/share/man

1b) If you want to install in /usr/local/sbin:
	./configure

2) Now, build it:
	make
	make install

3) You will need to run "depmod" for your new kernel, eg:
	depmod 2.6.29

6) If you want to hack on the source:
	autoreconf -i
	(or in full: aclocal -I m4 && automake --add-missing --copy && autoconf)

If this is all too complicated, I recommend getting and installing your
distribution package or source rpm instead.
